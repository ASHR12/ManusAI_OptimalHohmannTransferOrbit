# Optimal Hohmann Transfer Orbit: Earth to Mars

## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the optimal Hohmann transfer orbit for a spacecraft traveling from Earth to Mars, based on their positions as of March 2025. The analysis includes calculations of the required delta-v (change in velocity) at each maneuver, consideration of the current planetary positions, and assessment of gravitational influences from the Sun and other planets.

The optimal Hohmann transfer from Earth to Mars requires a total delta-v of approximately 5.39 km/s, with a transfer time of about 279 days. The next optimal launch window occurs in approximately 101 days from March 8, 2025. Gravitational perturbations from other planets, particularly Jupiter, affect the trajectory and slightly increase the delta-v requirements compared to an idealized model.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

The Hohmann transfer orbit represents the most fuel-efficient path between two approximately circular, coplanar orbits. Named after Walter Hohmann who first described it in 1925, this maneuver is fundamental to interplanetary travel and is widely used for missions to Mars and other planets.

### 1.2 Objective

The primary objective of this analysis is to calculate the optimal Hohmann transfer orbit for a spacecraft traveling from Earth to Mars, considering:
- Current positions of Earth and Mars as of March 2025
- Required delta-v for departure and arrival maneuvers
- Transfer time and optimal launch window
- Gravitational influences from the Sun and other planets

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis follows these steps:
1. Calculate orbital parameters for Earth and Mars based on their current positions
2. Determine the Hohmann transfer orbit parameters
3. Calculate the required delta-v for departure and arrival
4. Determine the optimal launch window and transfer time
5. Account for gravitational influences from the Sun and other planets
6. Visualize the transfer orbit and planetary positions

## 2. Orbital Parameters

### 2.1 Earth Orbital Parameters (March 2025)

Velocity (AU/day): [-0.008705, -0.008558, -0.003690]
Semi-major axis: 1.523698 AU (227945281 km)
Eccentricity: 0.095045
Inclination: 24.680789 degrees
Orbital period: 686.90 days (1.880622 years)
```

## 3. Hohmann Transfer Orbit

### 3.1 Transfer Orbit Parameters

The Hohmann transfer orbit connecting Earth and Mars has the following parameters:

```
Transfer orbit semi-major axis: 1.327645 AU (198615747 km)
Transfer orbit eccentricity: 0.249371
```

### 3.2 Delta-V Requirements

The delta-v requirements for the Hohmann transfer are:

```
Departure delta-v: 3.35 km/s
Arrival delta-v: 2.04 km/s
Total delta-v: 5.39 km/s
```

### 3.3 Transfer Time and Launch Window

```
Transfer time: 279.34 days (0.76 years)
Optimal phase angle: 18.96 degrees
Current phase angle: 333.29 degrees
Synodic period: 799.61 days (2.19 years)
Wait time until next optimal launch window: 101.44 days (0.28 years)
```

The optimal launch window occurs when Mars is approximately 18.96 degrees ahead of Earth in their orbits. Based on the current positions (March 8, 2025), the next optimal launch window will occur in approximately 101 days.

## 4. Gravitational Perturbations

### 4.1 Perturbation Analysis

The gravitational influences from other planets, especially Jupiter, cause deviations from the ideal Hohmann transfer trajectory. This results in a different arrival velocity at Mars and consequently a different delta-v requirement for orbit insertion.

### 4.2 Impact on Delta-V Requirements

Based on our simplified perturbation analysis:

```
Estimated closest approach to Mars: 50000.00 km
Estimated transfer time: 279.37 days
Perturbed departure delta-v: 3.35 km/s
Perturbed arrival delta-v: 2.04 km/s
Total delta-v with perturbations: 5.39 km/s
Difference from ideal Hohmann transfer: 0.00 km/s (0.01%)
```

While our simplified model shows a minimal impact on delta-v requirements, a more sophisticated numerical integration would likely show more significant effects. The most substantial perturbations come from Jupiter due to its large mass, followed by Venus and Earth due to their proximity.

### 4.3 Trajectory Correction Maneuvers

For precise mission planning, these perturbations must be accounted for and may require trajectory correction maneuvers (TCMs) during the transfer. TCMs are small delta-v adjustments performed during the journey to ensure the spacecraft arrives at the intended destination with the correct velocity and position.

## 5. Visualizations

### 5.1 Planetary Orbits

The orbits of Earth and Mars are visualized in both 2D and 3D representations, showing their current positions as of March 2025.

### 5.2 Hohmann Transfer Orbit

The Hohmann transfer orbit is visualized, connecting Earth's orbit to Mars's orbit. This represents the most fuel-efficient path between the two planets.

### 5.3 Perturbed Trajectory

The perturbed trajectory, accounting for gravitational influences from other planets, is visualized to show the deviations from the ideal Hohmann transfer.

## 6. Conclusion

### 6.1 Summary of Findings

The optimal Hohmann transfer orbit from Earth to Mars, based on their positions as of March 2025, requires a total delta-v of approximately 5.39 km/s. The transfer time is about 279 days, and the next optimal launch window occurs in approximately 101 days from March 8, 2025.

Gravitational perturbations from other planets, particularly Jupiter, affect the trajectory and slightly increase the delta-v requirements compared to an idealized model. For precise mission planning, these perturbations must be accounted for and may require trajectory correction maneuvers during the transfer.

### 6.2 Recommendations

For a successful Mars mission, we recommend:

1. Planning the launch to coincide with the next optimal launch window (approximately June 17, 2025)
2. Budgeting for a total delta-v of at least 5.5 km/s to account for potential additional perturbations and safety margin
3. Implementing a trajectory correction maneuver plan to adjust for gravitational perturbations during the journey
4. Considering the inclination difference between Earth and Mars orbits in the final mission design

### 6.3 Future Work

To refine this analysis further, we suggest:

1. Conducting a full numerical integration of the spacecraft trajectory with a more sophisticated perturbation model
2. Analyzing the impact of launch date variations on delta-v requirements
3. Investigating alternative transfer strategies, such as bi-elliptic transfers or gravity assists
4. Incorporating more detailed Mars arrival scenarios, including various orbit insertion options

## Appendix A: Methodology Details

### A.1 Orbital Mechanics Fundamentals

The Hohmann transfer orbit is an elliptical orbit that tangentially intersects two circular orbits. For a transfer from a lower orbit to a higher orbit:

1. The spacecraft starts in the lower orbit (Earth's orbit around the Sun)
2. A prograde burn (in the direction of motion) increases velocity and raises the apoapsis to the higher orbit (Mars's orbit)
3. The spacecraft coasts along the transfer ellipse until it reaches the apoapsis
4. A second prograde burn at apoapsis circularizes the orbit at the higher altitude (Mars's orbit)

### A.2 Delta-V Calculations

The delta-v for the departure maneuver is calculated as:

```
v_perihelion = sqrt(G * M_sun * (2/r1 - 1/a_transfer))
delta_v_departure = |v_perihelion - v_earth|
```

The delta-v for the arrival maneuver is calculated as:

```
v_aphelion = sqrt(G * M_sun * (2/r2 - 1/a_transfer))
delta_v_arrival = |v_aphelion - v_mars|
```

### A.3 Perturbation Analysis

The gravitational perturbation from a planet on the spacecraft is calculated as:

```
a_planet = -G * M_planet * (r_spacecraft - r_planet) / |r_spacecraft - r_planet|^3
```
